Every automation idea sounds glamorous—until you are asked to prove the upside. This playbook gives growth teams a simple, trusted way to prioritize ideas and convert the best ones into full projects with confident ROI projections.

## Step 1 — Capture the Current Cost

- Document the people hours and tools currently powering the workflow.
- Quantify the error rate or drop-off points that automation could eliminate.
- Tag each workflow with a business objective (pipeline, retention, CSAT).

## Step 2 — Score The Opportunity

Use a 1–5 scale for each dimension and multiply the scores:

- **Volume:** How often does the workflow run?
- **Complexity:** How many systems and approvals are involved today?
- **Risk:** What happens if the automation misses the mark?
- **Time-to-value:** Can we see a tangible outcome this quarter?

> Tip: For leadership buy-in, pair the high score with a short story of the human pain the workflow creates today.

## Step 3 — Design a Proof of Value

- Plot a small surface area (one product line, one territory, one customer tier).
- Run a manual simulation and note where humans unplug the process.
- Define KPIs to measure success: cycle time, conversion lift, saved hours.

## Step 4 — Tell the Story With Numbers

![Scorecard sample showing ROI scores and potential savings](/placeholder.svg)

- Estimate time saved = baseline hours × automation coverage × hourly rate.
- Calculate upside revenue = conversion lift × average deal value.
- Highlight second-order benefits: faster onboarding, richer analytics, happier teams.

## Step 5 — Keep the Engine Honest

- Review the scorecard quarterly and retire automations that no longer pay off.
- Catalog new inputs: product changes, data freshness, compliance updates.
- Feed insights back into marketing and sales enablement loops.

## Make It Repeatable

Teams that scale automations consistently do three things:

- Hold monthly “automation council” working sessions.
- Publish a simple dashboard showing pipeline, savings, and customer metrics.
- Loop customer-facing teams into beta programs so feedback arrives fast.
